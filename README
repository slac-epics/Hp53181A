--------------------------------

I - Building the Hp53181A Frequency Counter module:
--------------------------------------------------------

(1) The Hp53181A module can be built in two ways (a) with asyn and GPIB drivers or 
    (b) with asyn and stream modules.

(2) Original code from Stephanie Allison was built with ASYN/GPIB combination. 
    Hp53181AApp contains this original code.

(3) Support for streamDevice was added by Shantha Condamoor. 
    streamHp53181AApp contains streamDevice support.

(4) The stream protocol file has been defined and added to streamHp53181AApp/Db/Hp53181A.proto.db.
    The files Hp53181A.stream.db and Hp53181ASet.stream.db contain the database record definitions 
	using these stream protocols. 

(5) A sample subsititutions file, Hp53181ATest.substitutions, has been provided for IOC applications.
    Override $(sys), $(dev), $(link) and $(address) in the substitutions file with the actual IOC name, 
	GPIB bus (also called as link) and GPIB port (also called as address) on the bus.

(6) Add asyn (and if using stream, streamdevice) to configure/RELEASE and clean/rebuild Hp53181A module.


II - Adding the Hp53181A package to your IOC application:
--------------------------------------------------------
Link Hp53181A and asyn libraries into your app by adding to 
    xxxApp/src/Makefile:

   xxx_LIBS += devHp53181AGpib
   xxx_LIBS += asyn
   xxx_LIBS += stream (if using streamDevice, stream)
   
Note that the order of the above libraries is important.

(3) Add the following .dbd files to xxxApp/src/Makefile 
    or to xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd:

   xxx_DBD += devHp53181AGpib.dbd (if using ASYN/GPIB) or stream.dbd (if using streamDevice)
   xxx_DBD += asyn.dbd
   xxx_DBD += devGpib.dbd
   xxx_DBD += drvAsynIPPort.dbd
   xxx_DBD += drvVxi11.dbd
   xxx_DBD += drvAsynSerialPort.dbd

(4) Add Hp53131A databases to your application.  For an example see:
	Hp53181A/<release>/Hp53181AApp/Db/Hp53181ATest.substitutions

    Note that this substitutions file sets up for 2 frequency counters - one for
    476.3 and the other for 358.5MHz.  Both use channel 2.  Change the frequency
    values (in multiple places) to match yours.

III - Adding Hp53181A database and LAN box configuration to your IOC startup file:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Load database created in the previous section (before iocInit).

(2) Add LAN box configuration before iocInit.

    #E5810Reboot("<ip_address>",0)
    vxi11Configure("<lan_box_link_name>","<ip_address>",0,0.0,"gpib0",0 ,0)
    asynSetOption("<lan_box_link_name>",0,"rpctimeout","10")

    Note that the <lan_box_link_name> must match the macro in the 
    substitutions file.  Each LAN box must have a unique link name.

(3) Remember to manually set the GPIB address on the frequency counter to 
    match the one in the substitutions file.  Each GPIB device on a LAN box
    must have a unique address.

(4) A test EDM display is available for diagnostics:
    Hp53181A/<release>/Hp53181AApp/srcDisplay/Hp53181A_diags.edl
    It requires the same same sys and dev macros that are in the 
    Hp53181ATest.substitutions file.

(5) If the frequency counter indicates a GPIB error, try:
    (a) From the display, set "Acq State" to OFF.
    (b) Power-cycling the frequency counter.
    (c) From the display, push "Reconfigure Counter".
    (d) Push "Update Status" multiple times and verify that the "HW Status"
        shows "+0,"No error" and the "Acq Status" shows "NO_ALARM".
    (e) Verify the "ID" and "Option" and "Value(Hz)" are correct.  The
        value updates every second.
